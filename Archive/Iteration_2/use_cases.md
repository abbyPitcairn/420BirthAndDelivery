## Demo #2 Use Case (Patient Search)
**Scenario:**

**Steps involved in a search:**
1. User enters patient's ID (in a GUI environment, clicks on the user's mother information)
2. The system reads the Patient's mother's ID value and searches through the list of Patient objects until it finds the one with a matching ID
3. The system then displays the basic information of the Patient object for the mother. This includes:
   - Name
   - Date of birth
   - Patient ID
   - Patient Mother ID
   - Records
4. The system displays the information found in the mother's Records to the user.

   - "Heart Disease"
   - "Asthma"
   - etc.
