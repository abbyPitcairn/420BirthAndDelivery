For Iteration 3 (our final pass), teams will
• Produce their “final” code
• Present (in an order to be determined by team leads) their
work on either April 28 or 30
• Fifteen-minute presentations covering your team’s work
(most of it), a tour of your repo (enough that someone else
could explore it) and your team dynamics (short, but
reflective)
• Repo to be in final form by May 2 and a link submitted via
BrightSpace (as per previous iterations)
