# How to Run EarlyDraft.java

This is a very early draft for use cases.

## How to Run

1. **Open your terminal or PowerShell**
2. **Navigate to the root of the project folder**  
   This is the folder that contains the `Archive/` and `bin/` folders.

3. **Compile the file into the bin folder (Please compile it in the /bin to keep it cleaner!**)
```bash
javac -d bin Archive/Iteration_1/EarlyDraft.java
java -cp bin Archive.Iteration_1.EarlyDraft
