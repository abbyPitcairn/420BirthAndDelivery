# 420 Project: Health in Ghana  
## 👶 Team Birth and Delivery

### 👥 Team Members  
- **Abby Pitcairn** – Team Lead  
- **Nathaniel Serrano** – Peer Programming Team 1  
- **Abdifatah Abdirahman** – Peer Programming Team 1  
- **Ashley Pike** – Peer Programming Team 2  
- **Josh Thyng** – Peer Programming Team 2  

### 📁 Repository Overview  
The repository is organized into an `Archive` directory, which contains the contents of **Iterations 1, 2, and 3**.  
- **Iteration 3** is the most complete and builds on the foundation laid in the earlier versions.  
- For the clearest picture of our final implementation, we recommend starting with **Iteration 3**.
- The Project Presentation materials are available in `Birth and Delivery.pdf`.

#### 🗂️ Iteration 3 Structure  
- **Domain Model** – Defines the scope and core concepts of the project.  
- **DeliveryRecord & BabyRecord** – Java classes used to model delivery and baby health records.  
- **DeliveryRegister** – A database-like structure for managing a collection of delivery records.  
- **EarlyDraft & DeliveryRecordTest** – Early prototypes and test code used to develop and validate the system.  
- **GUI Files**  
  - `DeliveryRecordGUI` and `UseCaseDemoGUI` – Java Swing interfaces designed for use by healthcare workers to interact with the system.  
- **UseCases.md** – A collaboratively developed document detailing key system use cases, created by the full team throughout the project.

### 🧑‍💻 Use of AI Tools
- AI tools were used to ask clarifying questions on how code should be written or cleaned up. 
- AI tools were used to auto-generate the long DeliveryRecord private variable declarations and its constructor.
- AI tools were used to suggest the solution to the issue of multiple babies in a single DeliveryRecord and created BabyRecord's outline.
- AI tools were also utilized to create most of `UseCaseDemoGUI.java`, as well as `DeliveryRecordGUI.java` due to our lack of experience in working with Swing.
